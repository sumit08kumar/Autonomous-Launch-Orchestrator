# Test Results

## Backend Component Tests ✅

All backend components have been successfully tested:

### PlannerAgent ✅
- Successfully creates structured launch plans from natural language goals
- Generates tasks with proper role assignments (marketing, developer, legal, sales)
- Includes deadlines, priorities, and task descriptions
- Fallback mechanism works when LLM response parsing fails

### RoleAgent ✅
- Successfully generates role-specific content for tasks
- Supports multiple roles: marketing, developer, legal, sales
- Produces detailed, actionable content for each role
- Content generation is contextually appropriate

### N8NIntegration ✅
- Workflow mapping functions correctly
- Maps tasks to appropriate n8n workflows based on role and type
- Handles webhook triggering (expected to fail without n8n running)
- Error handling works properly for connection failures

## Integration Status

### Database Models ✅
- SQLAlchemy models defined for Task and ExecutionLog
- Proper relationships and constraints
- Database creation functions implemented

### API Endpoints ✅
- FastAPI endpoints defined for all core operations
- CORS enabled for frontend integration
- Proper error handling and response formatting

### Frontend Dashboard ✅
- Streamlit application with three main pages
- Task creation, management, and monitoring interfaces
- Real-time status updates and filtering capabilities

### Docker Configuration ✅
- Complete docker-compose setup with all services
- PostgreSQL database configuration
- n8n workflow engine integration
- Environment variable management

## Next Steps for Full Testing

1. **Database Integration**: Requires PostgreSQL running
2. **n8n Workflows**: Requires n8n service with imported workflows
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Full system integration test
4. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: API communication testing

## Known Limitations

- n8n workflows are simulated (no real API integrations)
- Database requires external PostgreSQL instance
- OpenAI API calls require valid API key
- Some features require manual n8n workflow import
